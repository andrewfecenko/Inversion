## Product Detail

A mobile application. The application would function as a daily journal, with each entry potentially including the sections shown in the attached image as the base. We want to show users what they're repeatedly doing wrong, so they can stop making those mistakes.

While there are other applications like [Wunderlist][wunderlist-link], which allows you to create todo lists for daily activities, and [Habitica][habitica-link],
which focuses on creating habits to improve your productivity, our application would focus on minimizing mistakes. This is an extra feature that would exist on top of the basic journal. Other journal apps, like [Diaro][diaro-link] seem to focus on recording long thoughts or capturing moments. We want journals with our app to focus on tracking progression. A section like "Day Summary" is there to provide context. What's more important is that the user can figure out what needs to change for them to better achieve their goals, which is where highlighting mistakes is helpful.

## Target Audience

Our target audience are teenagers and young working adults who are used to using daily journal applications but cannot be motivated by existing applications that mainly focus on creating 'future improvements'. As mentioned in the product detail, our users will benefit better from understanding their 'past mistakes': the idea of highlighting mistakes stems from the idea of inversion, which is a method for solving problems by attempting to address them backward. Instead of trying to come up with ideas on how to advance towards a goal, a user would try to avoid things that definitely wouldn't bring him closer to it. Inverting a problem doesn't always work out, but it does help avoid trouble.


## Method

The idea of highlighting mistakes stems from the idea of inversion, which is a method for solving problems by attempting to address them backward. Instead of trying to come up with ideas on how to advance towards a goal, a user would try to avoid things that definitely wouldn't bring him closer to it. Inverting a problem doesn't always work out, but it does help avoid trouble - it's like a filter that helps avoid stupidity. 

We will be coding in Python, and using [Kivy][kivy-link] library to build a mobile app that runs on android.

Writing a small Python application that uses markdown for text and provides a simple GUI for inserting information daily is something that can be done by a single developer in one day. But the base project is extensible, and we plan to make this an Android application with extra features and better design, it's something that could maybe take up two whole months. We will have to come up with creative ideas to make our project stand out from other commonplace task apps. We plan to discuss further ideas and to improve our project as we go along.

## Potential Challenges

We will have to try our best to differentiate our app from numerous other task-manager/daily-planner apps out in the market. Programming-wise, our major challenges will relate to how we want to implement the technical parts of "finding repeated mistakes". Each team member will have to work on enhancing their knowledge on natural language computing.
