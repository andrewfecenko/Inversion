## Goal

## Summary

* What are we planning to build? \n
A mobile application. The application would function as a daily journal, with each entry potentially including the sections shown in the
attached image as the base. We want to show users what they're repeatedly doing wrong, so they can stop making those mistakes.

* Who are the users? \n
Teenagers and young working adults (those who are busy and familier with technologies)


* Why do we think users will find it valuable? \n
While there are other applications like Wunderlist (https://www.wunderlist.com/), which allows you to create todo lists
for daily activities, and Habitica (https://habitica.com/static/front),
which focuses on creating habits to improve your productivity, our application would focus on minimizing mistakes.
This is an extra feature that would exist on top of the basic journal. Other journal apps, like
Diaro (http://www.diaroapp.com/) seem to focus on recording long thoughts or capturing moments. We want journals with our app
to focus on tracking progression. A section like "Day Summary" is there to provide context.
What's more important is that the user can figure out what needs to change for them to better achieve their goals,
which is where highlighting mistakes is helpful.

The idea of highlighting mistakes stems from the idea of inversion, which is a method for solving problems by attempting
to address them backward. Instead of trying to come up with ideas on how to advance towards
a goal, a user would try to avoid things that definitely wouldn't bring him closer to it. Inverting a problem doesn't
always work out, but it does help avoid trouble.
