## Goal

## Team Members
* Yueti Yang <br/>
I took CSC324 last term and is familiar with Racket. Also, I had experiences in other programming languages such as Java, C, Python and Node.js. I am available mostly on every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. But we can also meet anytime when I am not in class.

* Asako Matsuoka <br/>
I have some experience with Python, C, Java, PHP, web programming and DB programming but not so proficient in any of them. I took CSC324 last semester so I know a bit about Racket too (have never written any plugins though). I can meet anytime except during the class time since I live very close to campus.
