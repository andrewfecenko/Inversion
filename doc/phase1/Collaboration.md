## Goal

All of the team members share a clear picture of what we want to bring about for the project and are excited to deliver the software application in the near future. To meet the final goal, we will set realistic milestones for each phase and pursue it with determination and passion. Based on team members’ skills and interests, three of us: Abrar, Chae (Chris) and Andrew will be mainly in charge of the back-end part and the rest of members: Yueti (Elsie), Asako, Huan (Elaine) and Angel will be working on the front-end. Although assigned different roles, there is no clear distinction between the back-end and the front-end teams – all team members should share the skills and knowledge to make improvements or enhancements.

## Team Members

* Yueti (Elsie) Yang <br/>

I took CSC324 last term and is familiar with Racket. Also, I have experience with other programming languages such as Java, C, Python and Node.js. I am available mostly on every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. But we can also meet anytime when I am not in class.

* Asako Matsuoka <br/>
I have some experience with Python, C, Java, PHP, web programming and DB programming but not so proficient in any of them. I took CSC324 last semester so I know a bit about Racket too (have never written any plugins though). I can meet anytime except during the class time since I live very close to campus.

* Abrar Hussain  

I have previous experience using mainly C++ and Python. I took CSC324 last term, and I have used Kivy
a tiny bit (for a small project last summer). I'm familiar with web programming and SQL. I'm available most of the time
on weekdays.

* Huan (Elaine) Wei <br/>

I have some experience with Python, C, Java, Racket and SQL. I am in process of learning Web programming. I took csc324 last term so I know the basics of racket. My schedule is flexiable, I can meet anytime during weekdays when I am not in class.

* Chae (Chris) Ahn <br/>

I majorly code in python and C or C++, but also have experience with java, Racket, SQL, and HTML. I took CSC324 last semester and it was a lot of fun. I live close to campus as well and am available on all weekdays unless there is a midterm or another assignment due.

* Angel You <br/>

I have experience with Python, Java, C, basic HTML and I took CSC324 so I some Racket. I'm still not super confident with my programming skills, but I can do digital art, which may or may not come in handy. I am mostly free outside class time, but I commute so I have to know the meeting time beforehand.

## Meetings
##### January 29, 2016
- Present members: Yueti (Elsie), Asako, Angel, Huan (Elaine), Chae (Chris)
- Gary demonstrated his Racket projects he has developed, and briefly explained what we can do to help him in our project. Probably we will be implementing Racket plugins.
- Gary will send us a list of things that we can work on.

##### February 8, 2016
- Present members: All team members.
- We discussed some backup ideas for our project (instead of working on a Racket plugin). We went through a couple of
ideas, including making a grocery Uber app, a programmer meetup app, and a Linux screencaster application. 
Our TA suggested that it would be a good idea to look at the complexity of each of our project
ideas to find something suitable for two months of work. In the end we decided to stick to creating our journal
application. 
- In order to come to an agreement on which product we want to create, we started off with five ideas, and then each
member cast their top three choices. The bottom two choices were removed from selection, and then we repeated the
process with the remaining three choices (and one vote per member). 

## Collaboration

There were a few different roles that each of our group members could take for this phase. We did not decide on who would take specific roles, but whoever was willing to make a contribution acted accordingly. 

##### Communication with clients/managers (Gary, Joey, Tricia)
- Some of us visited Gary in person and reported the details to other members but not everyone in the group could be fully aware of what we were going to do.
- Email worked better because in this way everyone in the group could gain the most recent more accurate information.
Communication within the group
- We originally used Facebook messenger, but we had difficulties keeping track of previous discussions. For example, some of us could easily miss important messages from other members.
- We started using Slack instead to make sure that every group member is involved in the discussion.

##### Coming up with ideas
- Physical meeting: None of us took notes, so the meeting did not produce anything meaningful although everyone contributed to the discussion. We might want to have a noter taker in the next phase to improve our productivity during a meeting.
- Meeting on video chat: While discussing, each member collaboratively took notes on google doc. This tool worked very well for gathering/organizing ideas and setting up a meeting that every group member could attend. 

##### Updating current status of our project
- Members who were most aware of the current status of the project updated. 
If we are going to have a note taker in the next phase, this person will update the meeting details.
- Some meeting details were updated a few days after the actual meeting. Updating them on time will be more helpful to those who were not present at the meeting.
