*Asako Matsuoka
I have some experience with Python, C, Java, PHP, web programming and DB programming but not so proficient in any of them. I took CSC324 last semester so I know a bit about Racket too (have never written any plugins thoguh). I can meet anytime except during the class time since I live very close to campus.
