I have some experience with Python, C, Java, PHP, web programming and DB programming but not so proficient in any of them. I took CSC324 last semester so I know a bit about Racket too (have never written any plugins though). I can meet anytime except during the class time since I live very close to campus.

## Meetings
##### January 29, 2016
- Present members: Yueti, Asako, (Professor Gary Baumgardner)
- Gary demonstrated his Racket projects he has developed, and briefly explained what we can do to help him in our project. Probably we will be implementing Racket plugins.
- Gary will send us a list of things that we can work on.

##### February 8, 2016
- Present members: All team members.
- We discussed some backup ideas for our project (instead of working on a Racket plugin). We went through a couple of
ideas, including making a grocery Uber app, a programmer meetup app, and a Linux screencaster application. 
Our TA suggested that it would be a good idea to look at the complexity of each of our project
ideas to find something suitable for two months of work. In the end we decided to stick to creating our journal
application. 
- In order to come to an agreement on which product we want to create, we started off with five ideas, and then each
member cast their top three choices. The bottom two choices were removed from selection, and then we repeated the
process with the remaining three choices (and one vote per member).
