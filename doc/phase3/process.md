# Process Report
### Initial Planning
###### How we organized ourselves and the tools we used
For group meetings, we used Slack, Google Hangout, and Facebook chat. We held meetings every week, and sometimes extra meetings were held (depending on the workload). Usually we held face-to-face meetings. However, if some of the group members were not available, we held meetings on Google hangout. Both online meetings and physical meetings went well. 

We used Github for source version control. For each feature, a member created their own feature branch and worked on it. He/she would add and commit all the changes to his/her local branch. Then in order to push to the master branch, he/she would send a pull request and wait for other team members accept the pull request. If there is no conflict, then new work is merged immediately to the project. Otherwise, conflicts would be solved by the member who sent the original pull request, and a new pull request would be sent after that.


### Update Meetings
###### March 10, 2016: Abrar, Chris @ BA
- Brainstormed our schdule for phase three.
- Determined the tasks to be done in phase three.

###### March 11, 2016: Elsie, Asako @ BA
- Discussed who to assign each tasks to, and decided to self-assign issues and work on it.

###### March 15, 2016: Elsie, Asako, Andrew, Elaine, Chris @ BA
- Summarized the lessons we learnt from last phase and what we could improve for this phase. We also discussed new tasks for the upcoming phase and adjusted some of the tasks we wished to implement from last planning meeting. 
- Andrew and Chris focused on improving the backend database features. They implemented and stablized database functions for updating/deleting/retrieving data (functions in db_functions.py)
- Elsie, Asako and Elaine collborated on writing reports.

Y-axis represent days. Large, Medium, Small size tasks were converted to 3, 2, 1 days. In this phase, we could not quite finish all the tasks we planned to. We plan to finish the remaining work by the demonstration day.


### Work Distribution
##### Distribution using issues:
In the initial planning meeting for each phase, we brainstormed all the features to implement for the phase and assigned them different sizes. Then we entereed them into issues on our Github repository. Each team member self-assigned themselves tasks.


###### Rationale behind our decisions
We decided to approach task distribution within phase 3 this way due to the heavy workload everyone was experiencing in March. Instead of having frequent offline meetings, group members agreed to self-assign tasks once issues rose according to our implementation plan. In case more than one person was working on the same issue, we left it empty, because Github issues only allows one assignee.
