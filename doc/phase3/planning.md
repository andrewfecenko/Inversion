#Planning 

### Initial Planning
##### Front-end
- Make update_entry and collection front end retrieve data from database 
(since we have been using an array of sample data for testing in previous phases).
- Make update_entry front end insert data into database.
- Enable delete/edit buttons in update_entry (retrieve user input and update database).
- Mistakes Summary page: This page displays history of the user’s mistakes. At first, we’ll try to display the most 
commonly appearing  mistakes based on the most frequent nouns and verbs appearing in mistake sentences. 
- Yesterday’s Mistakes page: This page lists yesterday’s mistakes. 
- Improve UI for already existing pages and make designs consistent over different pages.

##### Back-end 
- Implement functions to delete information from the database.
- Implement functions to update information in the database. 
- Implement functions to filter an entry given a specific day. 
- Implement functions to extract most common nouns and verbs from a sentence (used to get information about mistakes).
