#Planning 

### Initial Planning
##### Front-end
- Make update_entry and collection front end retrieve data from database 
(since we have been using an array of sample data for testing in previous phases).
- Make update_entry front end insert data into database.
- Enable delete/edit buttons in update_entry (retrieve user input and update database).
- Mistakes Summary page: This page displays history of the user’s mistakes. At first, we’ll try to display the most 
commonly appearing  mistakes based on the most frequent nouns and verbs appearing in mistake sentences. 
- Yesterday’s Mistakes page: This page lists yesterday’s mistakes. 
- Improve UI for already existing pages and make designs consistent over different pages.

##### Back-end 
- Implement functions to delete information from the database.
- Implement functions to update information in the database. 
- Implement functions to filter an entry given a specific day. 
- Implement functions to extract most common nouns and verbs from a sentence (used to get information about mistakes).

### Updated plan
Due to team members having busy schedules, we started work late on the project. Some of the features we were planning to implement by March 16th will be delayed to March 28th (Demo day).

##### Front-end
- Creating UI for yesterday’s mistakes and the mistakes summary page was delayed. 
- Making all of the pages (except for the Add entry page and Update entry page) consistent was delayed.
- Making the Collection page (refer to [collect.py](https://github.com/csc301-winter-2016/project-team12/blob/master/collect.py))  retrieve data from the database was delayed.

##### Back-end
- Implementing functions to extract most common nouns and verbs from a sentence was delayed.
