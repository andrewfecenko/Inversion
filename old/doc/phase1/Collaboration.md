## Goal

All of the team members share a clear picture of what we want to bring about for the project and are excited to deliver the software application in the near future. To meet the final goal, we will set realistic milestones for each phase and pursue it with determination and passion. Based on team members’ skills and interests, three of us: Abrar, Chae (Chris) and Andrew will be mainly in charge of the back-end part and the rest of members: Yueti (Elsie), Asako, Huan (Elaine) and Angel will be working on the front-end. Although assigned different roles, there is no clear distinction between the back-end and the front-end teams – all team members should share the skills and knowledge to make improvements or enhancements.

## Team Members

* Yueti (Elsie) Yang <br/>

I took CSC324 last term and am familiar with Racket. Also, I have experience with other programming languages such as Java, C, Python and Node.js. I am available mostly on every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. But we can also meet anytime when I am not in class.

* Asako Matsuoka <br/>
I have some experience with Python, C, Java, PHP, web programming and DB programming, but I am not very proficient in
any of them. I took CSC324 last semester, so I know a bit about Racket too (have never written any plugins though). I can meet anytime except during the class time since I live very close to campus.

* Abrar Hussain  

I have previous experience using mainly C++ and Python. I took CSC324 last term, and I have used Kivy
a tiny bit (for a small project last summer). I'm familiar with web programming and SQL. I'm available most of the time
on weekdays.

* Andrew Fecenko <br/>
I have experience with Python, C, Java, Racket, SQL Databases and Web programming in Flask (Python Framework). I'm willing to learn whatever is needed for the project. I'm available most of the time while not in class including weekends (Live close to campus).

* Huan (Elaine) Wei <br/>

I have some experience with Python, C, Java, Racket and SQL. I am the in process of learning web programming. I took
csc324 last term so I know the basics of Racket. My schedule is flexible. I can meet anytime during weekdays - when I am not in class.

* Chae (Chris) Ahn <br/>

I majorly code in python and C or C++, but also have experience with java, Racket, SQL, and HTML. I took CSC324 last semester and it was a lot of fun. I live close to campus as well and am available on all weekdays unless there is a midterm or another assignment due.

* Angel You <br/>

I have experience with Python, Java, C, basic HTML. And I took CSC324, so I know some Racket. I'm still not super
confident with my programming skills, but I can do digital art (which may or may not come in handy). I am mostly free outside class time, but I commute so I have to know the meeting time beforehand.

## Meetings
##### January 29, 2016
- Present members: Yueti (Elsie), Asako, Angel, Huan (Elaine), Chae (Chris)
- Gary demonstrated his Racket projects he has developed, and briefly explained what we can do to help him in our
project. We will probably be implementing Racket plugins.
- Gary will send us a list of things that we can work on.

##### February 8, 2016
- Present members: All team members.
- We discussed some backup ideas for our project (instead of working on a Racket plugin). We went through a couple of
ideas, including making a grocery Uber app, a programmer meetup app, and a Linux screencaster application. 
Our TA suggested that it would be a good idea to look at the complexity of each of our project
ideas to find something suitable for two months of work. In the end we decided to stick to creating our journal
application. 
- We came to an agreement on which product we want to create. We gathered some ideas on [Google Doc][google-doc-link], and then each
member casted their top three choices. The bottom two choices were removed from selection, and then we repeated the
process with the remaining three choices (and one vote per member).

## Collaboration

There were a few different roles that each of our group members could take for this phase. We did not decide on who would take specific roles, but whoever was willing to make a contribution acted accordingly. 

##### Communication with clients/managers (Gary, Joey, Tricia)
- Some of us visited Gary in person and reported the details to other members, but this didn't work well (because we
couldn't be sure that all team members were informed).
- Email worked better because in this way everyone in the group could gain the most recent and accurate information.
Communication within the group
- We originally used Facebook messenger, but we had difficulties keeping track of previous discussions. After messages
scrolled up too far in the message feed, it became difficult to reference the older discussions. 
- We started using Slack instead to make sure that every group member is involved in the discussion - and to easily keep track of past links and files. 
On Slack we can separate discussion into different channels based on the disccusion topic.

##### Coming up with ideas
- Physical Meeting: None of us took notes, although everyone contributed to the discussion. We want to have a note taker in the next phase
to track what we're doing at each meeting.  
- Meeting on video chat: While discussing, each member collaboratively took notes on Google Doc. This tool worked very
well for gathering and organizing ideas. Using a video chat was also very convenient for most group members.  

##### Updating current status of our project
- If we are going to have a note taker in the next phase, this person will update the meeting details.
- Some meeting details were updated a few days after the actual meeting. Updating them on time will be more helpful to those who were not present at the meeting.

##### Roles & Decision making
- Since we have a large group with seven members, we decided to take a democratic approach when making decisions:
everyone voted through Slack. 
- We have not given members specific roles yet. Abrar, Andrew and Chirs showed interest in backend tasks. Asako,
Elsie, Elaine and Angel showed interest in frontend tasks. Angel might take on some artistic roles later on.
